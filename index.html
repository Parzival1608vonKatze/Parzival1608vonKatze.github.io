  <h2>## Why just text?</h2>
In an effort to promote the project in the hope that more people will turn away from the dumpster fire that is the modern web.  
Gemini is plain text written in a markdown-like syntax.  
Links can only be written and displayed one per line (similar to gopher). 
There are no images, no video and no advertisements!
And since this website is hosted for free by a very questionable service provider called 000webhost and I don't have money to rent a Gemini-Server. This is normal html 5 but made to look like Gemini..
